The software architecture for developing the game efficiently used, Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture. This architecture helps easy to maintain and can be extended easily. Event driven programming, Interoperability, Software Architecture and Virtual Identity are implemented in this Quest. The main objective of the development of this game is to evaluate my understanding in the above mentioned.
